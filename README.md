# Key Findings
**Model Performance Overview**: The Gradient Boosting model exhibits strong performance and generalization for both heating (HL) and cooling load (CL) predictions, with R-squared values near 1.0 across all datasets, indicating nearly perfect fit and prediction accuracy.

**Heating Load Predictions**: Heating load predictions are highly accurate with a training RMSE of 0.27, validation RMSE of 0.45, and test RMSE of 0.427, demonstrating the model's precise fit and consistent performance across different data sets.

**Cooling Load Predictions**: Cooling load predictions, while accurate, show slightly higher errors with a training RMSE of 0.39, validation RMSE of 0.97, and test RMSE of 0.786, indicating a need for further refinement to achieve the precision seen in heating load predictions.

**Consistency and Robustness**: The model demonstrates robustness and consistency, with test R-squared values of 0.998 for HL and 0.993 for CL, suggesting strong predictive capabilities and reliability for practical applications.
